### Are private blockchains disruptive?

The above was our question for last week. Here’s what one of our readers had to say:

*“No. Private blockchains are only useful for development and testing of smart contracts that will eventually be deployed to public networks. Implementing them for the enterprise is misuse of the technology and is just a waste of resource.”*
