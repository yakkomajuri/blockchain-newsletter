### Welcome to The Blockchain Newsletter! Thank you all for joining and being early supporters of this initiative. ðŸš€

Our goal is to compile and distribute high-quality content about Blockchain/DLT on a weekly basis, helping you start the week informed and having learned something new. We will not spam you, aiming to send only one message a week - unless some important announcement simply cannot wait. 

The Newsletter will come every Monday and will contain a few news articles providing a general overview of what's going on, brief mentions about the crypto market and suggested resources for expanding your knowledge about the technology, split into technical and non-technical content. 

It's worth noting that there are no bots involved ðŸ¤– - the content will be hand-picked and sent out by humans. As such, the community is more than welcome to get involved! If you produce or come across a great piece of content, feel free to send it over to me directly here on WhatsApp. 

Additionally, we aim to also release an email version of this newsletter very soon, so stay tuned. 

And last but not least, if this group happens to fill up over the course of the week, do not worry! You can invite your friends to join our second group, which will distribute the exact same content (so there's no need to join both). Here's the link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/Bkp3qBo2pNJKE3SQo5gSVn

Our first edition will come out next week. In the meanwhile, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Let's grow together ðŸŒ±

**That's it for today - See you next Monday!**
